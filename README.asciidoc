= eXXcellent programming challenge

This repository provides the project scaffold for a simple
programming challenge. Though the challenge is very simple
and a rather synthetic use-case, your results are a helpful
starting point to discuss your programming flavor, skills
and methodology.


== Goal

Implement a solution for the given tasks which aims for

* robustness & correctness
* readability & maintainability
* clean software design & architecture

Be prepared to discuss your implementation and software design
decisions. Show us how you would solve the task when working on your day-to-day job.

Feel free to come up with own ideas & solutions. There is no plain
"right" or "wrong". Instead, we want to talk to you
about _how_ you achieved your goal and about your thoughts and design
idea and process.

If you feel bored by our challenge, feel free to provide
creative alternative solutions and/or choose other technologies/
languages, if you think they would be a better fit.



== Tasks

=== Time estimation
Between ~1 hour up to ~3.5 hours,  +
depending on your previous experience & development environment.

=== Task

Weather::
    In `weather.csv` you’ll find the daily weather data of a single month.
    Read the file, then output the day number (column one `Day`) of the day with
    the smallest temperature spread (difference between maximum &
    minimum temperature of the day.)
    The maximum temperature is the second column `MxT`, the minimum
    temperature the third column `MnT`.

Football::
    The `football.csv` file contains results of the
    English Premier League. The columns labeled ‘Goals’
    and ‘Goals Allowed’ contain the total number of goals scored
    by and against each team (so Arsenal scored
    79 goals themselves and had 36 goals scored against them).
    Read the file, then print the name of the team with the smallest
    difference in ‘Goals’ and ‘Goals Allowed’.

Task::
    1. Try to write a single program, which is able to solve the "Weather" 
       challenge. 
    2. Then try to refactor & extend your solution, that it additonally 
       supports the Football challenge. 

Process::
* Favour the software design goals described under _Goal_ over other goals 
  like _performance_ or _feature set_.
* Try to follow a test-driven development approach.




== Getting started

=== Getting a copy
The starting point for every challenge is provided as a branch in a Gitlab.com/GitHub
hosted Git repository. Be careful to adjust the URLs below
accordingly.

To start

=== Fork or directly clone the repository

```
git clone https://[gitlab|github].com/exxcellent/programming-challenge.git
```
or if you've forked the repository then
```
git clone git@[gitlab|github].com:YOURNAME/programming-challenge.git
```

See what challenges are available by listing the branches present:
```
git branch -a
```

=== Switch to the branch of the challenge assinged
```
cd programming-challenge
git checkout challenge-CHALLENGENAME
```

=== Building and running
The project scaffolds provides a Maven `pom.xml` as starting
point. You should be able to start with any IDE or text editor
you are convenient with.

After installing Maven 3.x you should be able to

Run the main class _de.exxcellent.challenge.App_::
    `mvn clean compile exec:java`

Build & test your project::
    `mvn clean test`.

Or use your IDE functionality::
    to run & debug you program.

== Submitting your results

Ideally you provide your solutions as Git repository with
appropriate commits and descriptions. If you have a GitLab.com
or GitHub account, please feel free to publish your solution
there.
